# V1.0.2
Added cookies-control with stuff from a new installed package: "@vueuse/nuxt".

The cookie-message-box isn not added to the index-page, but only to the ...slug-page, where "giscus" commenting is loaded.

- See the compoent, "giscus/ConfirmCookies.vue"
- The compoent is loaded in "giscus/GithubComments.vue".

## "vueuse/nuxt"-package is added.
For now this is used from vueuse:
- useOnline
- useConfirmDialog
- useStorage
